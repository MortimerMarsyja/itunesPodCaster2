# Inditex entry Exam:
This is my own approach on a small size bundle for making a fast and performing platform.

### Main technologies:
- Preact
- Vite
- Panda
- R Testing library
- Playwright
- Tanstack Router

## Why Preact? 

For three reasons, 
- its a lighter library than React working just as fine
- has better performance
- I haven't ever used it
(since I am making an exam, I might as well learn something new while I am at it, 
the differences between React and Preact are not major so am expecting only upsides)

### While at it...
I'd like to build a small global state utility using signals for Preact.

## Testing

For testing I will be using react testing library and maybe TDD (depending on the time).

finally playwright possibly for E2E testing.

## Tanstack Router, why?
While most of the people are using React Router, Tanstack 
offers full typesafety validation
